  caveats <<~EOS
    WhiskerFlow needs Microphone and Accessibility permissions to record and
    paste at your cursor. Grant them in System Settings > Privacy & Security.

    The first transcription downloads a Whisper model (~150 MB). To stay fully
    offline, switch the engine to "Apple Speech (built-in)" in Settings.
